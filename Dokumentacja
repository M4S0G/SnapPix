# Introduction to SnapPix Project Documentation

## Purpose of the Document

The purpose of this document is to outline the comprehensive framework for the SnapPix application, a cutting-edge social media platform for real-time photo sharing. This document aims to serve as a guide for developers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the project, providing detailed insights into the project's scope, functionalities, technical specifications, and implementation strategies.

## Project Overview

SnapPix is an innovative social media application that enables users to share and interact with photos in real-time. Drawing inspiration from popular platforms such as Instagram, SnapPix is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for capturing life's moments, exploring content from other users, and fostering a community through likes, comments, and follows. The application is built on the latest web and mobile technologies, ensuring high performance, scalability, and security.

### Definitions

- **User Profile:** A dedicated space displaying the user's published content and personal information.
- **Cloud Technology:** Backend infrastructure that provides data storage and computing resources over the internet.
- **Image Processing Algorithms:** Computer algorithms that perform operations on images to improve quality, resize, or compress them.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users must be able to register for a new account and log in securely.
   - The system must implement password protection for user accounts.

2. **Photo Sharing:**
   - Users should be able to upload photos to their profiles.
   - The application must support image resizing and compression for optimized storage and loading times.

3. **Interactions:**
   - Users must be able to like and comment on photos.
   - The system should display the number of likes and comments on each photo.

4. **User Profiles:**
   - Users should have personal profiles displaying their uploaded photos and information.
   - The application must allow users to follow other profiles.

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance:** The application must load and respond quickly to user interactions.
2. **Scalability:** The system should be capable of handling a growing number of users and data without degradation in performance.
3. **Security:** Data protection measures must be in place to secure user data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for a wide range of users.

## System Architecture (UML Diagrams)

The document will include UML diagrams such as:
- **Class Diagram:** To represent the structure of the system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and the relationships between the classes.
- **Sequence Diagram:** To depict the sequence of operations that occur during a particular functionality or process within the application.
- **Component Diagram:** To illustrate the organization and dependencies among a set of components.

## User Interface Design

The user interface design section will provide mockups and descriptions for key screens within the application, including:
- Login/Registration Page
- Home Page
- User Profile
- New Photo Upload Screen
- Profile Editing Screen

## APIs Utilized

This section will outline the external and internal APIs used by SnapPix, including:
- Cloud storage services for photo storage.
- Image processing services for optimizing photo uploads.
- Authentication services for secure login and registration processes.

## Testing Strategy

The document will detail the testing methodologies and tools used to ensure the application's functionality, performance, and security. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and security testing procedures.
